Most Apache Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface. It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently. Here are some open source icon sets for both personal and commercial use (though some require a link back to the authors website):

* http://icons8.com/[icons8] (as used in the link:../powered-by/powered-by.html[Estatio] app) - styled for Win8, Android and MacOS
* http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library[tango desktop] icon set - as used in Linux GNOME and KDE desktops
* http://thenounproject.com/[the noun project] community of icon providers (both free and commercial)
* http://www.flaticon.com/[flaticon] - free vector icons
* http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/[Google material design] and http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/sticker-sheets.html#[zip here]
* http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/[batch] (300+ icons)


You are also free to use these icon sets, with no restrictions:

* https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/haywood.zip?raw=true[haywood]
* https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/nogl.zip?raw=true[nogl]

If you know of any others freely usable and easily accessible, let us know through the link:./support.html[mailing list].
